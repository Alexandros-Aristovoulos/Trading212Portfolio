# Trading212Portfolio
### Description
The goal of this project is to get your Trading212 portfolio, calculate your returns and show everything in a graph without having to log in to the trading 212 website. 
This is achieved by getting the order information from a provided csv and/or the gmail of the user and searching in yahoo finance for the current price of the stocks.
For a more interactive version of this project check out [Trading212DesktopApp](https://github.com/alex999ar/Trading212DesktopApp) which is a fully functional desktop app.

### How to use
Place your (order data).csv which you can download from Trading212 
[(instructions here)](https://community.trading212.com/t/new-feature-export-your-investing-history/35612) **and selecting ONLY the orders as included data**.
You need to name this file as orders and replace my own file.

You can also use your gmail (if it receives the emails from Trading212) in order to automatically update the orders data. Beware my script only gets the data
from the "Contract Note Statement from Trading 212" so if you are informed about an order via the "Monthly statement" the code won't know anything about it.

**Change the variables GET_EMAIL and EXTRA_SEARCH_ARGS in the myPortfolio.py accordingly.**

### Disclaimer
**This project is designed for accounts with EURO currency**. It converts Usd, GBp, and Nok to euro. If you want to change it to your currency or add more conversions
follow the [instructions below](https://github.com/alex999ar/Trading212Portfolio#change-currency). 

### Change currency
Go to `myPortfolio.py` and change the variables USER_CURRENCY and USER_SYMBOL accordingly

For example for GBP you need to have `USER_CURRENCY = "GBP"` and `USER_SYMBOL = "Â£"`

### Updates
Changed the logic we use to find the stocks and get their price. 
* First we search for the stock in the London stock exchange because that's the exchange Trading212 "prefers". To do that we just add ".L" at the end of the stock name. 
* If we don't find the stock this way then we try with the original name. (That's how we find most of the US stocks)
* If none of the above work then we use the isin and get the first ticker that matches it. Then using that ticker we get the price. (That's how we find stocks in other
exchanges)
